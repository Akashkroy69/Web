        Imagine you're at a pool party with friends. The friends on the left side of the pool are like the left-floated
        elements. They stay together and create space for others.
        The friends on the right side of the pool are like the right-floated elements. They also stay together and make
        room
        for other elements.
        This paragraph is like the big table in the middle of the pool. It doesn't float anywhere, it just stays in its
        place. But the image elements in the paragraph will float to left and right.
