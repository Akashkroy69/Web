    <h1>Display</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The display property in CSS determines how an HTML element is rendered or displayed on a web page.
            It defines the type of box an element generates and how it interacts with other elements in the document
            flow.Here are some common values of the display property and their explanations:</p>

        <h3>display:block</h3>

        <p>block: Elements with display: block; create a block-level box. They start on a new line and take
            up the full width available in their parent container.lock-level elements include < div>, < p>, < h1> to <
                            h6>, and more </p>

        <h3>display:inline</h3>
        <p>inline: Elements with display: inline; create an inline-level box. They do not start on a new line and only
            take up as much width as necessary for their content. Inline elements include < span>, < a>, < strong>
                        </strong></p>
        <h3>display:inline-block</h3>
        <p>inline-block: Elements with display: inline-block; are similar to inline elements but behave like block-level
            elements in terms of layout. They do not start on a new line but can have specified width and height.</p>
