        // Promises:

        // A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, 
        // and its resulting value. A Promise can be in one of three states:
        // 1. pending:The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        // 2. resolved: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
        // 3. rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

        // Creating a Promise: Promise using the Promise constructor, which takes a function as its argument. 
        // This function, called the executor, takes two parameters: resolve and reject.
        let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            console.log("Hello promise");
            resolve(true)
        })

        // console.log("Start")
        // setTimeout(function () {
        //     console.log("hello after 2 second")
        // }, 2000)

        // console.log("End")

        console.log(promise)

        // Using Promises:
        // Chaining Promises:
        // Error Handling:


        // why promises are used? promises are used for parallel execution.
