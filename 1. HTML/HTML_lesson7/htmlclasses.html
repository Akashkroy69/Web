     HTML classes are a fundamental concept in web development that allows you to define and apply styling and
     functionality to specific elements on a webpage. Think of them as labels or identifiers that you can attach to HTML elements, 
     such as headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and more. By assigning elements to specific classes, you can group and target 
     them collectively using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for consistent styling across your website. This modular approach makes 
     it easier to manage and update the design of your site, as changes to a class's style are automatically applied to all elements 
     bearing that class. Additionally, classes can also be used to attach JavaScript functions, allowing you to add interactive 
     behavior to elements sharing the same class. This separation of concerns enhances code organization and makes your webpage 
     more maintainable and adaptable.</div>
