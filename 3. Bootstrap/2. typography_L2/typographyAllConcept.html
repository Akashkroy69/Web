    <!-- name="viewport": This attribute specifies the name of the metadata, which is "viewport" in this case. 
        The viewport meta tag is used to control how the web page's content should be scaled and displayed within 
        the viewport of the user's device.

        content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1": This attribute specifies the content or value associated 
        with the "viewport" metadata.

        width=device-width: This part of the content specifies that the width of the viewport should be set to the
         device's width. In other words, it tells the browser to make the web page as wide as the screen or viewport of the device.

        initial-scale=1: This part of the content sets the initial zoom level or scale factor to 1. It means that when the web page 
        is initially loaded, it should be displayed at a 1:1 scale, which means it's not zoomed in or out. -->

<!--Training flow:
    1. explain container and container-fluid
    2. introduce class and use different color classes,display-1-4, bg-dark. : Q; how do we apply multiple classes in any element?
    3. class: small, lead, mark, code
    3. explain that we have .h1-.h6 class as well that can be used to apply the text formats of different headers with any element-->
